# Image Loading Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem
Images were working locally but not showing on Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause
1. **Duplicate image folders**: Images existed in both `/images/` (root) and `/public/images/`
2. **Inconsistent path references**: Some components used absolute paths (`/images/`) while others used `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`
3. **CSS background images**: CSS files used absolute paths that don't work in production builds

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Root Images Folder
- Deleted `/images/` folder from Git tracking
- All images now only exist in `/public/images/`

### 2. Updated JavaScript Components
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Navbar.js` - Updated logo path to use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`
- `src/components/Footer.js` - Updated logo path to use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`

**Before:**
```javascript
<img src={`/images/mrmn_logo.PNG`} alt="MRMN Salt Logo" />
```

**After:**
```javascript
<img src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/images/mrmn_logo.PNG`} alt="MRMN Salt Logo" />
```

### 3. Updated CSS Background Images
**Files Modified:**
- `src/styles/Home.css` - Hero background image
- `src/styles/Products.css` - Products hero background image
- `src/styles/About.css` - About hero background image

**Before:**
```css
background: url('/images/products/bo7era.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;
```

**After:**
```css
background: url('%PUBLIC_URL%/images/products/bo7era.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;
```

## Why This Works

### In React Apps:
- **`process.env.PUBLIC_URL`** in JavaScript: Automatically resolves to the correct base URL in production
- **`%PUBLIC_URL%`** in CSS: Gets replaced during build with the correct base URL
- **`public/` folder**: Files in this folder are served at the root of the domain

### On Vercel:
- Only files in `public/` are accessible in production
- The build process replaces `%PUBLIC_URL%` with the correct domain
- Absolute paths like `/images/` don't work because they bypass React's build process

## Files Already Using Correct Paths
These files were already correctly using `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`:
- `src/pages/Home.js` - All image references
- `src/pages/About.js` - All image references
- `src/pages/Products.js` - All product images

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to Git
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy
4. All images should now display correctly

## Commands to Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Update image paths for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Verification
After deployment, check:
- ✅ Logo in navbar and footer
- ✅ Hero background images on all pages
- ✅ Product images on Products page
- ✅ Gallery images on About page
