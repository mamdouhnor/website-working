## üéØ Common Causes & Solutions

### Cause 1: Project Not Deployed Yet
**You're seeing this because the project hasn't been deployed to Vercel yet.**

**Solution:**
Follow the deployment steps:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd c:\md7t\lunching\MRMNSALT-Website

# Make sure Git is initialized
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to GitHub first (if not done)
# Create repo at https://github.com/new
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mrmnsalt-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Then deploy to Vercel
```

**Deploy via Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign in/Sign up
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait for deployment to complete

---

### Cause 2: Wrong URL
**You might be accessing an old or incorrect URL.**

**Solution:**
After deploying, Vercel gives you a URL like:

- `https://mrmnsalt-website-username.vercel.app`

Make sure you're using the correct URL from your Vercel dashboard.

1. Go to Vercel dashboard

5. Click on the failed deployment
6. Read the build logs to see what went wrong

---

### Cause 4: Project Deleted
**The project might have been deleted from Vercel.**

**Solution:**

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository again
